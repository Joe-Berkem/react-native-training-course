[React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) is a framework for building mobile apps using [React](https://reactjs.org/).

This training course focuses on learning the basics of React Native. On completing the course, you will have built three different apps, which gives you an excellent grounding to go on and build your own.

## Prerequisites

To complete this course, you'll need to be familiar with the following technologies:

- Modern JavaScript
- React

## Setting up Development Environment

Before you can start building React Native apps, you need to get your machine and mobile device setup.
