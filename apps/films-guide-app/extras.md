# Films Guide App: Additional Functionality

These requirements are not part of the core project, but can be implemented as enhancements.

- The API can return films that were earlier in the day, the app should not display these.
- The list of films should be refreshable (via pull-to-refresh).
- The list should group films by their next showtime (Today, Tomorrow, etc)
- The detail view should include a 'parallax' scroll effect
- The list view items should not be allowed to be pressed multiple times in quick succession

The completed app with these extras should resemble the following:
